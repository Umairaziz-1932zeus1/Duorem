The idea behind this app is to provide people who are not very familiar with
computer interfaces a simple and easy way to control a remote computer. Imagine
your grand parent needs a way to power a media server. Quick and efficiently!

The application uses Wake On LAN (WOL) technique to start a remote computer. You
need to make sure that your computer and network is set up for and support WOL.
The app can only power off or restart a Linux-based computer. It performs these
actions using secure shell (SSH). Your remote computer must be configured to
enable SSH connections. Username that is used for SSH must have sudo rights.

Note that SSH credentials are stored in application preferences unencrypted!
Anyone with root access can read it.
